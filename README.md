# 3D Modelling & Printing

A collection of various things that I've modelled or designed. Some can be printed with 3D printers or technology, some are just for educational purposes. All models are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0).

# Ruger Mark IV 22/45 

##   1) Bolt Ears
  This is the model of the back of the bolt such that they can be used to model a bolt racker/charger

##    2) Bolt Charger
  These are the models for a bolt charger that rotates onto the ears of the bolt. The pull lever arm is angled up away from the grip for  comfort and ease of function. Hardware for completeness can be found in Assembly file. (McMaster Carr PNs: 92505A242 and 91333A130). The "normal version" is oriented such that the lever is engages with your left hand, with your right hand remaining on the grip. The Left version is mirrored such that it is the opposite. The left hand remains on the grip and the lever is engaged with the right hand.

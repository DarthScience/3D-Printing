# 3D Modelling & Printing

A collection of various things that I've modelled or designed. Some can be printed with 3D printers or technology, some are just for educational purposes. All models are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0).


# C-MORE Railway Cover (Fullsize) 

  This is the model for a full size cover of the popular competition C-MORE Railway and othe fullsize C-MORE red dot sights. I've found that it works best when printed in TPU flexible palstic. 
  
# Beretta A400 Series Shell Catcher 

  This is the model for a a clip on style shell catcher for the Beretta A400 series shotguns. This is used when shooting singles trap primarily as it catches the shell as its ejected so as not to send it into the station next to you. This is based on the T&S style (now seemingly discontinued) that is very easily removable. So far the best print settings have been done with standard PLA.
  
# Ruger Mark IV 22/45 

##   1) Bolt Ears
  This is the model of the back of the bolt such that they can be used to model a bolt racker/charger

      B) BoltEars.STL

##    2) Bolt Charger
  These are the models for a bolt charger that rotates onto the ears of the bolt. The pull lever arm is angled up away from the grip for  comfort and ease of function. Hardware for completeness can be found in Assembly file. (McMaster Carr PNs: 92505A242 and 91333A130). The "normal version" is oriented such that the lever is engages with your left hand, with your right hand remaining on the grip. The Left version is mirrored such that it is the opposite. The left hand remains on the grip and the lever is engaged with the right hand.
